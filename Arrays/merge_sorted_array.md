# Question

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.


##### Example:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

# Optimal Solution


``` python
    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):
        i=m-1
        j=n-1
        k=n+m-1
        while i>=0 and j>=0:
            if nums1[i]>nums2[j]:
                nums1[k]=nums1[i]
                i-=1
            else:
                nums1[k]=nums2[j]
                j-=1
            k-=1
        while j>=0:
            nums1[k]=nums2[j]
            j-=1
            k-=1
            
```
